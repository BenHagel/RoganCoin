						<h2>Our Story</h2>
						<p>Here’s the deal. I know Joe Rogan. I mean, not really, but he knows my uncle. They went to school together and worked at a landscaping company. My uncle told Joe that I do crypto coins and Joe thinks it’s wicked sick, apparently. In fact, Joe (Joe Rogan, I call him Joe cause we’re friendly haha) was so impressed that he said he would like to endorse this coin on his podcast with over 20 million listeners! Isn’t that wild? He will be doing it soon I think.</p>
